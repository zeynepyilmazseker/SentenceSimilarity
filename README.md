#Sentence Similarity Detection
This project analyzes the semantic relationships between sentences using advanced NLP techniques, including BERT embeddings, cosine similarity, and pooling methods. The aim is to identify two semantically related sentences in a triplet while distinguishing the unrelated one.

#Features
Detect semantic relationships between sentences.
Utilize BERT Sentence Transformers for embeddings.
Compare CLS token, mean-pooled embeddings, and cosine similarity.
Analyze results for 50 sets of triplets (3 sentences per set).

#Technologies
Language: Python
Libraries:
sentence-transformers
scikit-learn
numpy
pandas

#Results
Semantic similarity scores calculated using cosine similarity.
Distinguishes unrelated sentences with high accuracy.
